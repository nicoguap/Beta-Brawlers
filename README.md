# Beta-Brawlers
A program I made my Sophomore year of high school. A beta mode of a 2D platformer Battle Royale-style shooter.

In order to run the program, download all the files and click on the .bat file. The .bat file is safe, you can edit it to look at what it is, it's just a runner for the .jar file.
have fun!
